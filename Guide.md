### Requirements for Making PaddleOCR Compatible with Stroke-Based Text Recognition

This document outlines the necessary modifications and extensions to PaddleOCR for incorporating stroke-based text recognition.

---

### **1. Objective**
Transform the PaddleOCR recognition pipeline to support stroke-based text recognition. The changes must allow for:
- Predicting sequences of strokes from input text images.
- Grouping strokes into hierarchical structures (e.g., sets of strokes).
- Mapping stroke sequences to characters or sequences of characters.
- Refining the final output using language models or post-processing techniques.

---

### **2. General Requirements**
1. **Modularity**: Ensure all changes are encapsulated in modular components that align with PaddleOCR’s existing structure.
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Preserve compatibility with existing PaddleOCR workflows.
3. **Reusability**: Design components for potential reuse in other recognition tasks.
4. **Customizability**: Allow the new pipeline to be configurable through YAML configuration files.

---

### **3. Specific Changes to PaddleOCR**

#### **A. Backbone: Feature Extraction**
1. Replace or extend the current backbone to handle features required for stroke-based recognition.
2. **Tasks for the Programmer**:
   - Implement a custom feature extractor (e.g., CNN, Vision Transformer).
   - Ensure compatibility with PaddleOCR’s data format and processing pipeline.
   - Register the new backbone using PaddleOCR’s `register_backbone` decorator.
3. **Acceptance Criteria**:
   - The backbone can output feature maps suitable for stroke-level predictions.

---

#### **B. Recognition Head: Stroke-Level Decoder**
1. Replace the sequence decoder to predict strokes instead of characters.
2. **Tasks for the Programmer**:
   - Implement a `HierarchicalDecoder` capable of:
     - Predicting individual strokes.
     - Grouping strokes into sets.
   - Add the decoder as a custom recognition head using `register_rec_head`.
3. **Acceptance Criteria**:
   - The decoder can output structured stroke sequences (e.g., `[[123], [234], [567]]`).

---

#### **C. Post-Processing: Stroke-to-Character Mapping**
1. Add a post-processing step to map stroke sequences into valid characters or words.
2. **Tasks for the Programmer**:
   - Implement a `CharacterMapper` to map stroke sequences to characters using:
     - Predefined stroke-to-character mappings.
     - Probabilistic models for ambiguous mappings.
   - Integrate a `PostProcessor` to refine the mapped sequences using:
     - Heuristic rules.
     - Language models for context-aware corrections.
   - Register the custom post-processing module with PaddleOCR.
3. **Acceptance Criteria**:
   - Post-processing accurately maps strokes to valid characters or words.
   - The final output matches the expected text format.

---

#### **D. Configuration File**
1. Extend PaddleOCR’s configuration system to support stroke-based components.
2. **Tasks for the Programmer**:
   - Add configuration options for:
     - Stroke-based backbone.
     - Hierarchical decoding head.
     - Stroke-to-character mapping and post-processing.
   - Ensure compatibility with existing YAML configuration structure.
3. **Acceptance Criteria**:
   - Users can specify the stroke-based pipeline components in a YAML file.

---

#### **E. Training Pipeline**
1. Modify the training loop to support stroke-based annotations.
2. **Tasks for the Programmer**:
   - Update the dataset loader to handle stroke-level ground truth.
   - Ensure loss functions are compatible with stroke-based outputs.
3. **Acceptance Criteria**:
   - The model can be trained using stroke-based annotations without errors.

---

#### **F. Inference Pipeline**
1. Extend the inference script to handle stroke-based predictions.
2. **Tasks for the Programmer**:
   - Modify the `infer_rec.py` script to:
     - Accept stroke-based input configurations.
     - Output stroke predictions and their mapped characters.
3. **Acceptance Criteria**:
   - The inference script outputs valid stroke and text predictions.

---

### **4. Code Organization**
Ensure new components are added to appropriate PaddleOCR directories:
- `paddleocr/modeling/backbones/`: Add the custom feature extractor.
- `paddleocr/modeling/heads/`: Add the hierarchical stroke decoder.
- `paddleocr/postprocess/`: Add the stroke-to-character mapper and post-processor.
- `configs/rec/`: Add a configuration file for the stroke-based pipeline.

---

### **5. Documentation**
1. Provide detailed docstrings for all new modules.
2. Create a README file explaining:
   - How to enable stroke-based recognition.
   - Configuration options for stroke-based components.
   - Example training and inference workflows.

---

### **6. Testing**
1. Write unit tests for:
   - Stroke feature extraction.
   - Stroke-level decoding.
   - Stroke-to-character mapping and post-processing.
2. Provide integration tests to validate the full pipeline.
3. **Acceptance Criteria**:
   - All tests pass with >90% code coverage for new components.

---

### **7. Deliverables**
1. Modified PaddleOCR codebase with stroke-based recognition components.
2. Configuration files for training and inference.
3. Unit tests and integration tests.
4. Documentation explaining the integration and usage of stroke-based components.

### **8. Example YAML Configuration**
```yaml
Global:
  use_gpu: true
  ...
Backbone:
  name: CustomFeatureExtractor
  architecture: ViT
  pretrained: true
