To address the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem and ensure accurate stroke recognition, character composition, and word formation, you need loss functions tailored to the different components of your system. Below are recommended loss functions and their specific applications:

---

### **1. Stroke Recognition (Vision Transformer)**
#### Loss Function: **Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE)**
- **Why:** Stroke recognition is a classification task where each set of strokes corresponds to a specific character or symbol. CCE helps minimize the classification error by comparing predicted probabilities to the true label.
- **Formula:**
  \[
  \mathcal{L}_{CCE} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{c=1}^C y_{i,c} \log(p_{i,c})
  \]
  where \( y_{i,c} \) is the one-hot encoding of the true label, and \( p_{i,c} \) is the predicted probability for class \( c \).

#### Augmentation:
- Use **label smoothing** to improve generalization and robustness to OOV strokes.

---

### **2. Character-Level Composition**
#### Loss Function: **CTC Loss (Connectionist Temporal Classification)**
- **Why:** When stroke sequences are mapped to character sequences, the alignment between strokes and characters may vary. CTC is ideal for sequence prediction without requiring pre-defined alignments.
- **Use Case:** Predict character sequences directly from variable-length stroke sequences.

#### Formula:
\[
\mathcal{L}_{CTC} = - \log \sum_{\pi \in \text{Alignments}(y)} P(\pi | x)
\]
  where \( x \) is the input sequence, \( y \) is the target sequence, and \( \pi \) are possible alignments.

#### Advantages:
- Handles missing or extraneous strokes.
- Allows predictions of varying lengths.

---

### **3. Word Formation (Dictionary Guidance and Language Model Integration)**
#### Loss Function: **Cross-Entropy with Weighted Dictionary Constraint**
- **Why:** To guide the model towards known dictionary words while allowing flexibility for OOV cases, you can incorporate a weighted loss.
- **Formula:**
  \[
  \mathcal{L}_{Word} = \alpha \mathcal{L}_{Dict} + (1-\alpha) \mathcal{L}_{Char}
  \]
  where:
  - \( \mathcal{L}_{Dict} \): Cross-entropy loss comparing predicted words to known dictionary entries.
  - \( \mathcal{L}_{Char} \): Loss penalizing deviations from predicted character sequences for OOV words.
  - \( \alpha \): Weight controlling the trade-off between dictionary adherence and OOV flexibility.

#### Alternative: **Beam Search with Edit Distance**
- Use **edit distance** (e.g., Levenshtein distance) to penalize deviations from the closest dictionary match during inference.

---

### **4. Subword Tokenization and Embedding Matching**
#### Loss Function: **Triplet Loss or Cosine Similarity Loss**
- **Why:** If you're using subword embeddings to represent characters or strokes, you need a loss to optimize embedding similarity for subword composition.
- **Formula (Triplet Loss):**
  \[
  \mathcal{L}_{Triplet} = \max(0, d(a, p) - d(a, n) + m)
  \]
  where:
  - \( d \) is the distance metric (e.g., cosine or Euclidean).
  - \( a \), \( p \), and \( n \) are anchor, positive, and negative samples.
  - \( m \) is the margin.

---

### **5. Handling OOV Words**
#### Loss Function: **KL Divergence for Probabilistic Models**
- **Why:** Use a probabilistic language model to predict plausible OOV words. The loss ensures the predicted distribution aligns with known word frequencies or contextual probabilities.
- **Formula:**
  \[
  \mathcal{L}_{KL} = \sum_{i} P_{true}(i) \log \frac{P_{true}(i)}{P_{pred}(i)}
  \]

#### Implementation:
- Train a language model to predict the next character or word in context.
- Penalize deviations from observed probabilities.

---

### **6. Regularization for Robustness**
- **Label Smoothing Loss:** Improves generalization by assigning a small probability to incorrect classes.
- **Dropout Regularization:** Reduces overfitting in Vision Transformers and language models.
- **Entropy Loss:** Encourages confident predictions by penalizing high entropy in the output probabilities.

#### Formula (Entropy Loss):
\[
\mathcal{L}_{Entropy} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{c=1}^C p_{i,c} \log(p_{i,c})
\]

---

### **Hybrid Loss Approach**
Combine the above losses into a single loss function tailored to your pipeline:
\[
\mathcal{L}_{Total} = \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{Stroke} + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{CTC} + \lambda_3 \mathcal{L}_{Word} + \lambda_4 \mathcal{L}_{Embedding}
\]
- Tune \( \lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3, \lambda_4 \) to balance the importance of each task.

By using these loss functions in a structured way, you can optimize stroke recognition, character composition, and word formation while effectively handling OOV scenarios.
